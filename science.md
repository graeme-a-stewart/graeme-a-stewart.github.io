# Science

## My Scientific Career

### Education

It all started back at the [Universtity of Glasgow](https://gla.ac.uk)...

- BSc Hons. 1st Class, Physics and Astronomy, University of Glasgow 1989
- PhD *Wave Propagation in Equal Mass Plasmas*, University of Glasgow 1992

### Employment

#### Postdoctorial Reasearcher, National Autonomous University of Mexico, 1993-1997

I worked in solar physics, developing large scale structure models of the solar
corona, among other things to do with the Sun.

#### C++ Software Developer, Dolphin Software Systems, Edinburgh, 1998-1999

Back in Scotland, I took some brief time away from academia and dipped my toes
in the world of professional software development (very early days of C++!).

#### Starlink Manager and Physics and Astronomy IT Manager, University of Glasgow, 1999-2005

Back in Glasgow, I ran various IT systems in the astronomy group for a few
years, as well as supporting departmental IT.

#### GridPP Data Management Coordinator and ScotGrid Tier-2 Coordinator, University of Glasgow, 2005-2010

The to the grid! The projects to support computing for the Large Hadron Collider
at CERN were starting and I joined [GridPP](https://www.gridpp.ac.uk) to work as
their Data Management coordinator, as well as later taking over the running of
the ScotGrid Distributed Tier-2 (with sites in Glasgow, Edinburgh and Durham).

Later I travelled to be based at CERN and help the ATLAS experiment with their
first data taking runs.

#### CERN Staff Scientist, EP-ADP Group, 2010-2012

Developing my expertise in data management, I joined the CERN EP-ADP group to
help design the next version of [Rucio](https://rucio.cern.ch), which has become
the de-facto standard tool for large scale scientific data management (so we
must have done a good job!).

#### ATLAS Software Physicist-Programmer, University of Glasgow, 2012-2017

After that, I returned to work for Glasgow, now taking senior roles in ATLAS
software development, including Core Software Coordinator and overall Software
Coordinator.

#### CERN Senior Staff Scientist, EP-SFT Group, 2017-date

At this time the [HEP Software Foundation](https://hepsoftwarefoundation.org)
was gathering momentum - I rejoined CERN, now to work in the *Software for
Experiments* group, supporting the HSF, as well as leading development of
software for the high-luminosity upgrade and beyond, in the
[AIDAinnova](https://aidainnova.web.cern.ch) and the CERN [EP
R&D](https://ep-rnd.web.cern.ch) projects.

Currently my [development efforts](/julia) are focusing using
[Julia](https://julialang.org) as a future language for high-energy physics.
