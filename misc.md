# Miscellanea

This is where I put random things that I want to comment on or highlight.

## Role Playing Games

I do love *Tabletop Role Playing Games* and I play at the [CERN Games
Club](https://games-club.web.cern.ch/rpgs).

In particular I am currently running a campaign using the
[Shadowdark](https://www.thearcanelibrary.com/pages/shadowdark) rules, called
*Echos of Albain* (which is unashamedly set in a weird magical fantasy
Scotland).

## Language Matters

### Data *is*

Data, as used in modern English, is a mass singular uncountable noun. Got it?

- [Data is a singular noun](http://purl.org/nxg/note/singular-data) (written by my good friend Norman)
