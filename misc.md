# Miscellanea

This is where I put random things that I want to comment on or highlight.

## Role Playing Games

I do love *Tabletop Role Playing Games* and I play at the [CERN Games
Club](https://games-club.web.cern.ch/rpgs).

In particular I am currently running a campaign using the
[Shadowdark](https://www.thearcanelibrary.com/pages/shadowdark) rules, called
*Echos of Albain* (which is unashamedly set in a weird magical fantasy
Scotland).

## Language Matters

### Data *is*

Data, as used in modern English, is a mass singular uncountable noun. Got it?

- [It's Time to End the 'Data Is' vs 'Data Are' Debate](https://www.vice.com/en/article/594aj8/its-time-to-end-the-data-is-vs-data-are-debate)
- [Data is a singular noun](http://purl.org/nxg/note/singular-data) (written by my good friend Norman)

### Underused Words

A [list of words](https://wordwarriors.wayne.edu/list) in English that deserve to be better known and more often used. Pick one each week and try to use it!

### The Singular *They*

*They* can be perfectly used as a gender neutral singular pronoun in English. In fact this use dates all the way back to the 14th Century, according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_they).
