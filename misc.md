# Miscellanea

This is where I put random things that I want to comment on or highlight.

## Role Playing Games

I do love *Tabletop Role Playing Games* and I looking for groups in Hamburg to
play with.

Recently I ran a 2 year campaign called *Echos of Albain*, set in a fantasy version of Scotland using the excellent [Shadowdark system](https://www.thearcanelibrary.com/pages/shadowdark).

## Language Matters

### Data *is*

### Underused Words

A [list of words](https://wordwarriors.wayne.edu/list) in English that deserve to be better known and more often used. Pick one each week and try to use it!

### The Singular *They*

*They* can be perfectly used as a gender neutral singular pronoun in English. In fact this use dates all the way back to the 14th Century, according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_they).
